# Netflix-Movie-Life-Impact-Analysis
##1.Project name:Netflix Movie Life Impact Analysis
##2.Project Overview
This analysis examined what makes Netflix movies highly impactful - defined as those that at least 80% of viewers would recommend to friends and family. Using data from 82 movies, we built a predictive model to identify the key factors that create lasting, share-worthy viewing experiences.
##3.Key Findings
###1.Data Insights
Complete dataset: No missing values in any of the 14 features tracked

Impact distribution: 31.7% of movies qualified as high-impact

Top genres for impact: Comedy, Thriller, Documentary, Animation, and Drama were most common among high-impact movies
##4.Model Performance
Accuracy: 68% at predicting high-impact movies

Strong predictive power: AUC score of 0.86 (where 1.0 is perfect prediction)

Better at identifying low-impact: Correctly predicted 88% of low-impact movies (15/17)

Room for improvement: Only caught 25% of true high-impact movies (2/8)
What Makes Movies Recommendable
The analysis identified these top 5 influential factors:

Release Year (newer movies tend to perform better)

Average Rating (higher rated movies get more recommendations)

Number of Reviews (more discussed movies spread further)

Main Genre (certain genres outperform others)

Discovery Method (how viewers found the movie matters)

##5.Business Implications
###1.For Content Teams:
Focus on Comedy, Thriller and Documentary genres which show high impact potential

Invest in newer releases as they tend to generate more recommendations

Create more review-worthy moments to boost engagement

###2.For Platform Teams:
Highlight highly-rated movies (≥8.8 average in our dataset)

Optimize recommendation algorithms for discovery methods that lead to impact

Develop "impact scores" to surface potentially viral content

Limitations & Future Improvements
##6.Model Enhancements:

Address the imbalance in high-impact predictions (currently only catching 25%)

Experiment with different algorithms to improve true positive rate

Incorporate review text analysis for deeper insights

##7.Data Expansion:

Increase dataset size beyond 82 movies

Add viewer demographic information

Include streaming duration and rewatch metrics

##8.Implementation Ideas:

Create an "Impact Predictor" dashboard for content teams

Develop A/B testing framework for recommendation strategies

Build real-time monitoring of emerging high-impact content

The model files and full analysis visualizations are available for further exploration.
